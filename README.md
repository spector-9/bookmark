# BookMark

BookMark is a simple c program to dump content of your clipboard in a tsv file.
Now some might ask why would we need to do that.
I designed this to create a portable bookmark utility that can just copy url in a tsv file that can be opened anywhere. 

*This only inputs the data into the file, it does not parse or change it. I believe it is better suited for program like awk and sed.*
